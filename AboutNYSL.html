            <h2>General Info</h2>
            <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide

              ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run
              by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
              parents and former league members.</p>
