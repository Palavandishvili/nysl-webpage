                        have an interest in learning and playing soccer, with opportunities to learn

                 <h3>General Info</h3>
                       <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
                        athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment to
                        learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between the
                        ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run
                        by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
                        parents and former league members.</p>
