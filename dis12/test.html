   <p>Feel free to email us at<a class="mail_anchor" href="mailto:nysl@chisoccer.org">nysl@chisoccer.org</a></p>

   <h4>Phone</h4> 
   <p>You may call us directly at (773) 555-8984.</p>  
   <p>As we are staffed mostly by volunteers, there is a good chance your call
           will not be picked up immediately. We recommend email as the preferred
           way of contacting us, but you may also leave us a brief voicemail with
           your name, number, and reason for calling and we will return your call.</p>
